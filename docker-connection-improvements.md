# Recent Changes Documentation

## Files Modified
1. docker_runtime.py
2. async_utils.py
3. containers.py

## Purpose
These changes improve the robustness and reliability of Docker container management across multiple hosts, particularly focusing on error handling and connection management.

## Changes Details

### docker_runtime.py
- Enhanced Docker host connection handling
- Added proper timeout and retry mechanism
- Better error logging for connection failures
- Added connection verification with ping and version checks
- Improved fallback mechanism to local Docker when remote hosts fail

Purpose: Ensure reliable connection to Docker hosts and graceful fallback when remote hosts are unavailable.

### async_utils.py
- Added directory creation handling for session metadata
- Improved error handling for FileNotFoundError
- Added proper cleanup for async tasks
- Better exception handling and reporting
- Fixed GENERAL_TIMEOUT constant definition

Purpose: Handle asynchronous operations more reliably, particularly for session management and file operations.

### containers.py
- Aligned Docker client handling with docker_runtime.py
- Added proper connection timeout
- Enhanced error handling for network issues
- Improved connection verification
- Better logging for connection status

Purpose: Ensure consistent container management behavior across different Docker hosts and reliable container cleanup.

## Overall Benefits
1. More reliable Docker host connections
2. Better error recovery and fallback mechanisms
3. Consistent behavior across different components
4. Improved logging for troubleshooting
5. Better handling of network issues and timeouts
